# DSA-Placement-Probems

Welcome to the DSA Placement Problems repository, designed specifically to help you excel in technical interviews at FAANG/MAANG companies. This repository is part of the Hacktoberfest celebration, inviting contributors from the global programming community to collaborate on this open-source project.

## About

The goal of this repository is to compile a comprehensive collection of data structures and algorithms problems commonly encountered during placements at some of the most prestigious tech companies. We encourage contributors to submit problems and solutions in their preferred programming language, be it Python, Java, C++, or any other.

## Contribution Guidelines

To ensure the quality and relevance of the content, please adhere to the following guidelines:

- **Problem Relevance**: Ensure that problems are pertinent to the data structures and algorithms typically assessed in FAANG/MAANG placements.
  
- **Clear Problem Statements**: Provide a clear problem statement, examples of input and output, and any additional context for clarity.

- **Solutions and Explanations**: Include solutions in your preferred programming language, accompanied by explanations to enhance comprehension.

## How to Contribute

1. Fork the repository.
2. Add your problems and solutions.
3. Submit a pull request.
4. Your contributions will be reviewed and, upon approval, integrated into the repository.

Please give proper credit to the original sources of problems, if applicable. While the problems and solutions shared here are community-driven and may not guarantee success in interviews, they serve as a valuable supplementary resource for comprehensive preparation.

## Disclaimer

The problems and solutions in this repository are community contributions and may not guarantee success in FAANG/MAANG placements. This repository is intended as a supplementary resource for comprehensive preparation.

## Let's Contribute!

Let's come together, celebrate open-source, and empower fellow programmers to excel in their technical interviews at some of the most sought-after tech companies. Happy coding and contributing!
